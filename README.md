# Duolingo Clone

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Overview

The Duolingo Clone is a language learning application inspired by the popular Duolingo platform. It aims to provide users with an interactive and engaging way to learn new languages through various exercises and challenges.

## Features

- Interactive language exercises
- Progress tracking
- User authentication
- Responsive design
- Multi-language support

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the main application components and pages.
- `components/`: Reusable UI components used throughout the application.
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for managing state and logic.
- `lib/`: Utility functions and helpers.
- `public/`: Static assets such as images and icons.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
